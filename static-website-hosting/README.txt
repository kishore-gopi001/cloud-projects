Ever wondered what a simple, serverless web deployment pipeline looks like? This architecture diagram shows a clean and efficient way to host a static website (like a React, Angular, or plain HTML/CSS/JS site).

Here’s a breakdown of the powerful yet simple AWS services that make it work:

1. Developer / CI (Continuous Integration):
   - This is where code lives and automation begins. A developer pushes code to a repo (like GitHub), which triggers an automated pipeline (e.g., AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions) to build and prepare the application for deployment.

2. S3 Bucket:
   - Think of this as a highly reliable and secure cloud storage "bucket." It's the perfect place to host static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images). It's incredibly scalable and cost-effective.

3. CloudFront:
   - This is a Content Delivery Network (CDN). It doesn't just serve the website from one location; it distributes and caches it at data centers around the world. This means blazing-fast load times and a better experience for users everywhere.

4. ACM (AWS Certificate Manager):
   - This service provides free SSL/TLS certificates to enable HTTPS. It encrypts the connection between the user's browser and the website, ensuring security and trust.

5. Users:
   - The happy end-users accessing the website securely over HTTPS from anywhere on the planet, served quickly by the CloudFront CDN.

This setup is a classic example of a serverless architecture—highly available, secure, scalable, and cost-efficient without managing any servers!
